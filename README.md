The halalness of a product has a very important meaning in the culture and religion of many people around the world. 
Therefore, it is important for producers and consumers to ensure that the products they consume comply with the applicable halal principles. 
Raman spectrum technology has been highlighted in research and applications in various industries, including food. 
This method exploits the nature of the interaction of light with molecules, allowing us to obtain unique signatures from the molecules present in a product. 
In this context, it is shown how the Raman spectrum data classification technique can be applied to distinguish between contain lard and not contain products.
